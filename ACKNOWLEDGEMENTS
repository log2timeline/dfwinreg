dfWinReg, or Digital Forensics Windows Registry, provides read-only access to
Windows Registry objects. The goal of dfWinReg is to provide a generic
interface for accessing Windows Registry objects that resembles the Registry
key hierarchy as seen on a live Windows system.

dfWinReg originates from the Plaso project [https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso]
and the WinReg-KB project [https://github.com/libyal/winreg-kb]. It was largely
rewritten and made into a stand-alone project to provide more flexibility and
allow other projects to make use of the Windows Registry functionality.

dfWinReg is currently developed and maintained by:
